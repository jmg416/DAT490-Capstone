Belgium,2022-04-09,Humanitarian,Assistance,"On April 9, during the event ""Stand Up for Ukraine"", the Belgian Prime Minister announced that Belgium had set up a fund of 800 million EUR to support Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees. Since only 83 million EUR will be sent to Ukraine (see ""Sorce of Aid 2""), we previously reported this amount. On January 2023, the Belgian foreign ministry's official press release stated that 77 million EUR were spent on civilian assistance in 2022 (Source of aid 3). Thus, we assume that the initial 83 million EUR was a reserved budget for aid to Ukraine, and the Belgian government spent 77 million EUR from this value. Moreover, among the 77 million EUR listed, 10 million EUR were spent to help export grain and 6.4 million EUR to different human rights protection organizations, which we do not count.

Canada,2025-06-17,Humanitarian,Contribution,"On June 17th, 2025, on the final day of the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the following measures in support of Ukraine. Beyond the previously recorded CAD 2 billion package, Canada will allocate CAD 57,4 million in security-related assistance. According to Source of aid 2, this allocation supports a range of defence and security initiatives, including $45 million for Drone Capability Coalitions as well as drone procurement and projects supporting Canadian Armed Forces operations. Plus, the source mentions other destionations such as CAD 2.1 million in support to the NATO’s Science for Peace and Security initiative (which we do not sonsider as an entry since not directed to Ukraine); a funding of CAD 0,7 million to Natural Resources Canada to advance a project to improve operational energy efficiency in military operations, and CAD 11.7 million to be directed to bolster Ukraine’s cyber resilience via previously committed Anti-Crime Capacity Building Programme funding.

Given that the sum of these projects, excluding the CAD 2.1 million to the NATO’s Science for Peace and Security initiative, sum to CAD 54.7 million, we divide this allocation in two clusters: Military allocations (three entries) and Humanitarian allocation (two entries);
(i) Military: three entries for the CAD 45 million (in which we cannot fully distinguish among Drone Capability Coalitions, drone procurement, and projects supporting Canadian Armed Forces operations) 
(ii) Humanitarian: two entries; one for the CAD 0,7 million Natural Resources Canada project, and one for the CAD 11,7 million Anti-Crime Capacity Building Programme. 

In this entry, we report the CAD 11,7 million Anti-Crime Capacity Building Programme.",.,.,.,11700000.0,7426775.0,

Additional Information is availabe (look at NOH9): the Norwegian Government has decided to provide a total of NOK 3 billion in humanitarian support to Ukraine and to the refugee response in Ukraine’s neighbouring countries in 2025. The funding is part of the 12.5 billion kroner that Norway is providing in civil aid to Ukraine and Moldova in 2025. The funding will be channelled through established humanitarian organisations such as UN organisations, the International Red Cross and Red Cresent Movement, and Norwegian and international NGOs. This means that, out of the 12.5 billion NOK committed for the civilian part of the 2025 Nansen Program, 3 billion NOK will be deirected towards humanitarian aid and, therefore, the rest (12.5 - 3) will be financial aid. Again, inside this financial commitment for 2025 there is also 4.5 billion NOK commitment directly linked to the energy sector (NOF8). New information explicits that 350 million NOK out of the total 12.5 billion NOK related to the 2025 civilian aid committed to Ukraine will go to Moldova, therefore we subtract that amount. Also, new information (source of aid 2) explicits the civilian commitments for 2025: 4.5 billion NOK for energy security and energy supply, including nuclear security and purchases of natural gas (NOF8); 3 billion NOK for humanitarian assistance (NOH9); 3.3 billion NOK for budget support and reconstruction efforts (part of this entry); 750 million NOK for business development and private sector (part of this entry, waiting for new info); 540 million NOK for Civil society, accountability and governance (part of this entry, waiting for nee info).",.,.,.,4650000000.0,424543741.0,

Through its support, Norway will contribute to the efforts of local authorities in Ukraine to provide healthcare, education for children, local infrastructure, and social and cultural activities in cooperation with local organizations. The support is also intended to strengthen the decentralization process and local democracy – as well as reinforce the role of central authorities in national processes.

It mainly consists of three pillars. Pillar 1 (Ukraine Plan) sets to achieve social , econmonimc and environmental resilinece and reconstruction. Pillar 2 (Ukraine Investment Framework) consists of support to Ukraine “in the form of budgetary guarantee, financial instruments or blending operations” and Pillar 3 (Union accession assistance and support measures) should help alighn Ukraine to the EU for a possible future EU membership by strengthening the rule of law and democracy. The third pillar also includes administrative expenses. Annually EUR 12.5 billion will be paid by the fund, of which EUR 4.25 billion come in the form of grants.

The exceptional MFA will contribute to covering Ukraine´s financing gap, thereby supporting macro-financial stability in Ukraine and easing Ukraine´s external financial constraints. The exceptional MFA loan and eligible bilateral loans from G7 partners under the ‘Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine' initiative will be repaid by future flows of extraordinary profits accruing to central securities depositories in the EU as a result of the implementation of the immobilisation of Russian sovereign assets. The up to €35 billion MFA loan is the EU's contribution to the G7 loan of up to €45 billion. The new MFA operation will be linked to policy conditions that are consistent with the Ukraine Facility. The MFA loan is expected to be made available to Ukraine before the end of 2024, to be disbursed by the end of 2025, and to have a maximum duration of 45 years (maturity). New information available (Source of aid 3) clarifies that the EU part linked to the 50 billion USD in loans within the ERA framework is 18.1 billion EUR and not 35 billion EUR.
